48 Eco Friendly Products You Can Buy Today to Help Stop Plastic Pollution
ZERO WASTE FEATURED
20 Jan, 2024
To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: 
Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
In one study by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, nearly 93 percent of people tested positive for BPA (a potentially harmful chemical present in plastic products).
Think the problem is too big for you to make an impact?
Think again.
We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
One of the best ways to fight plastic pollution is to live by example and ensure the products you buy are produced with both ethics and the environment in mind.
Also, don't forget to share the journey with your friends and family.  The more friends you convince, the more people you share articles like this one with, the more people will begin using environmentally friendly products in their everyday lives, and that is how we change the world.
Scroll down to see where you can make some simple changes with eco-friendly products that can have big impacts on your environmental footprint.

2. Vegan Leather Tote
Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

3. Toilet Paper
Who Gives a Crap? sells extra-cushy 3-ply bamboo bathroom tissue in colourful paper packs. The co-founder (after learning that 800 children under 5 die daily from diseases caused by poor water and sanitation) decided to set this company up with his friends, donating 50% of profits to provide clean sanitation in developing countries. For the crowdfunding campaign, he sat on a toilet in their draughty warehouse and refused to move, until they raised enough pre-orders to start production. It took 50 hours, but they did it!

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste
The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.
In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.
What is the problem? How do we fix it?
The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.
We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.
Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.
We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.

ZERO WASTE FEATURED
20 Jan, 2024
To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: 
Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
In one study by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, nearly 93 percent of people tested positive for BPA (a potentially harmful chemical present in plastic products).
Think the problem is too big for you to make an impact?
Think again.
We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
One of the best ways to fight plastic pollution is to live by example and ensure the products you buy are produced with both ethics and the environment in mind.
Also, don't forget to share the journey with your friends and family.  The more friends you convince, the more people you share articles like this one with, the more people will begin using environmentally friendly products in their everyday lives, and that is how we change the world.
Scroll down to see where you can make some simple changes with eco-friendly products that can have big impacts on your environmental footprint.

2. Vegan Leather Tote
Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

3. Toilet Paper
Who Gives a Crap? sells extra-cushy 3-ply bamboo bathroom tissue in colourful paper packs. The co-founder (after learning that 800 children under 5 die daily from diseases caused by poor water and sanitation) decided to set this company up with his friends, donating 50% of profits to provide clean sanitation in developing countries. For the crowdfunding campaign, he sat on a toilet in their draughty warehouse and refused to move, until they raised enough pre-orders to start production. It took 50 hours, but they did it!

4. Sustainable watches

41. Oceanzen
Every year around 640, 000 tonnes of 'ghost fishing gear’ enter our ocean and become adrift. These can stay in the ocean for up to 600 years and are the silent killers of our marine life. Whales, seals, sharks, dolphins, turtles and so many more precious marine species are subject to suffocation and slow, painful deaths. In 2014, Oceanzen pioneered the use of a revolutionary fabric that supports the removal of marine debris from our oceans. They manufacture sustainable swimwear made of nylon waste such as recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets that have been recovered from our oceans and recycled. By regenerating waste, they're not only making it new again but saving a whole heap of precious, finite resources and energy whilst also reducing carbon emissions.

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste
The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.
In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.
What is the problem? How do we fix it?
The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.
We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.
Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.
We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.

48 Eco Friendly Products You Can Buy Today to Help Stop Plastic Pollution
ZERO WASTE FEATURED
20 Jan, 2024
To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: 
Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
In one study by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, nearly 93 percent of people tested positive for BPA (a potentially harmful chemical present in plastic products).
Think the problem is too big for you to make an impact?
Think again.
We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
One of the best ways to fight plastic pollution is to live by example and ensure the products you buy are produced with both ethics and the environment in mind.
Also, don't forget to share the journey with your friends and family.  The more friends you convince, the more people you share articles like this one with, the more people will begin using environmentally friendly products in their everyday lives, and that is how we change the world.
Scroll down to see where you can make some simple changes with eco-friendly products that can have big impacts on your environmental footprint.

2. Vegan Leather Tote
Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

3. Toilet Paper
Who Gives a Crap? sells extra-cushy 3-ply bamboo bathroom tissue in colourful paper packs. The co-founder (after learning that 800 children under 5 die daily from diseases caused by poor water and sanitation) decided to set this company up with his friends, donating 50% of profits to provide clean sanitation in developing countries. For the crowdfunding campaign, he sat on a toilet in their draughty warehouse and refused to move, until they raised enough pre-orders to start production. It took 50 hours, but they did it!

In 2014, Oceanzen pioneered the use of a revolutionary fabric that supports the removal of marine debris from our oceans. They manufacture sustainable swimwear made of nylon waste such as recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets that have been recovered from our oceans and recycled.

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste
The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.
In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.
What is the problem? How do we fix it?
The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.
We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.
Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.
We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.

ZERO WASTE FEATURED

ZERO WASTE

FEATURED

20 Jan, 2024

20 Jan, 2024

To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: 
Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
In one study by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, nearly 93 percent of people tested positive for BPA (a potentially harmful chemical present in plastic products).
Think the problem is too big for you to make an impact?
Think again.
We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
One of the best ways to fight plastic pollution is to live by example and ensure the products you buy are produced with both ethics and the environment in mind.
Also, don't forget to share the journey with your friends and family.  The more friends you convince, the more people you share articles like this one with, the more people will begin using environmentally friendly products in their everyday lives, and that is how we change the world.
Scroll down to see where you can make some simple changes with eco-friendly products that can have big impacts on your environmental footprint.

2. Vegan Leather Tote
Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

3. Toilet Paper
Who Gives a Crap? sells extra-cushy 3-ply bamboo bathroom tissue in colourful paper packs. The co-founder (after learning that 800 children under 5 die daily from diseases caused by poor water and sanitation) decided to set this company up with his friends, donating 50% of profits to provide clean sanitation in developing countries. For the crowdfunding campaign, he sat on a toilet in their draughty warehouse and refused to move, until they raised enough pre-orders to start production. It took 50 hours, but they did it!

In 2014, Oceanzen pioneered the use of a revolutionary fabric that supports the removal of marine debris from our oceans. They manufacture sustainable swimwear made of nylon waste such as recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets that have been recovered from our oceans and recycled.

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste
The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.
In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.
What is the problem? How do we fix it?
The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.
We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.
Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.
We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.

To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: 
Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
In one study by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, nearly 93 percent of people tested positive for BPA (a potentially harmful chemical present in plastic products).
Think the problem is too big for you to make an impact?
Think again.
We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
One of the best ways to fight plastic pollution is to live by example and ensure the products you buy are produced with both ethics and the environment in mind.
Also, don't forget to share the journey with your friends and family.  The more friends you convince, the more people you share articles like this one with, the more people will begin using environmentally friendly products in their everyday lives, and that is how we change the world.
Scroll down to see where you can make some simple changes with eco-friendly products that can have big impacts on your environmental footprint.

2. Vegan Leather Tote
Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

3. Toilet Paper
Who Gives a Crap? sells extra-cushy 3-ply bamboo bathroom tissue in colourful paper packs. The co-founder (after learning that 800 children under 5 die daily from diseases caused by poor water and sanitation) decided to set this company up with his friends, donating 50% of profits to provide clean sanitation in developing countries. For the crowdfunding campaign, he sat on a toilet in their draughty warehouse and refused to move, until they raised enough pre-orders to start production. It took 50 hours, but they did it!

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste
The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.
In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.
What is the problem? How do we fix it?
The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.
We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.
Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.
We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.

Some of the world’s top fashion houses are now replacing animal leathers with vegan leathers made from fruit. Many people believe the leather industry is a by-product of the meat industry, but it’s not. Most leather is processed in countries where there are little or no welfare laws for animals (or humans that make the leather, who are often subjected to toxic chemicals from the tanning process, which then go into the water supplies, and harm marine wildlife too). This apple skin tote is a vibrant beautiful urban shopper, which is lightweight but strong enough to hold a laptop.

Quality vegan shoes are made of several materials. You can of course find rope/jute sandals and natural rubber wellies etc. But for ‘everyday shoes’, the main material is Microfiber, which is gradually becoming more and more biodegradable, thanks to inventions like fruit leathers, which use up the waste from industry (apples, grapes, pineapples, cactus).

25. Stainless Steel Drink Bottles

Did You Know?
Every minute, around the globe, humans purchase a staggering one million plastic bottles.

This vast consumption isn't only financially costly with bottled water being an expensive choice, but it also exacts a terrible toll on our environment. Beyond the environmental impact, plastic and aluminum bottles pose potential health risks, often due to chemicals like BPA that can seep into your water.

Drinking enough water is essential for our well-being. But how you choose to drink it matters. The Onya Stainless Steel Drink Bottle stands out as a beacon of sustainable and healthy hydration. Made from food-grade 304 stainless steel - the trusted material within the food and beverage industries - our bottles are built without the need for linings and will never retain or leach flavours. Regardless of the number of refills or the beverage choice, your drink remains fresh and delightful.

The design of our drink bottle takes into consideration both function and form. Its curved ergonomic design ensures a comfortable grip, reducing the chances of slips. Yet, even if it does encounter a fall, the bottle's engineering is crafted to withstand common impacts. Crafted from the thickest possible grade of stainless steel, it offers durability without the burden of weight, aiming to serve you for years to come.

Every year around 640, 000 tonnes of 'ghost fishing gear’ enter our ocean and become adrift. These can stay in the ocean for up to 600 years and are the silent killers of our marine life. Whales, seals, sharks, dolphins, turtles and so many more precious marine species are subject to suffocation and slow, painful deaths. In 2014, Oceanzen pioneered the use of a revolutionary fabric that supports the removal of marine debris from our oceans. They manufacture sustainable swimwear made of nylon waste such as recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets that have been recovered from our oceans and recycled. By regenerating waste, they're not only making it new again but saving a whole heap of precious, finite resources and energy whilst also reducing carbon emissions.

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste

Everyday items for the Eco Warrior: Where to find the best eco friendly products to reduce plastic waste

The single most important issue facing modern humanity is climate change. We’ve all seen the evidence in our climate and in disturbing images from across the globe all over the news. The question is: what can we do about it? The key to tackling climate change is both macro and micro. It’s important that we, as individuals, take up the cause just as strongly as governments and corporations could and should. That’s where Onya and our reusable products come in. We understand what it means to live responsibly  in a modern world and apply those principles to all aspects of our business and in our daily lives.

In order to make the changes we want to see happen, we know the key to success is finding ways of adjusting your habits in a way that complements your current lifestyle. Habits won’t stick if they require a drastic change in behaviour so Onya began with a simple mission; Create innovative, environmentally friendly solutions that easily fit into your life. We are here to bring you solutions that make a difference, right to your doorstep. Australian based Onya has been offering the world innovative solutions to single use plastic waste since 2004.

What is the problem? How do we fix it?

What is the problem? How do we fix it?

The big problem, as we all know, is the long-term increase of the Earth’s temperature. We humans have been wreaking havoc on our atmosphere for a long time, and now our chickens are well and truly home to roost. Plastic is littering our oceans; our landfill is land-filled, and we throw away more and more each year.

We can all lessen our impact with  a simple approach. The six ‘R’s we live our lives by are: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle and Rot. If we can try and keep these principles in mind when making daily decisions, then we can start making a positive impact on our surroundings.

Onya goes that one step further. We are a B Corp certified company which, put plainly, means we have an obligation to meet the very highest of social and environmental standards. B Corps balance their profit with their purpose so that you, the consumer, know that your dollars do good.

We partner with only those who match our ethical commitments to ensure that we  bring you products manufactured the right way. Ethically made in China, our produce ranges are made by companies whose values echo our own and we have been working with them for many years. Every partner we work with is approved as socially and environmentally conscious. We prioritise proper workers’ rights, community impact, environmental credentials and, of course, you, our customer.
